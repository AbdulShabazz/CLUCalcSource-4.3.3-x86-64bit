CLUCalc/CLUViz is a freely available software tool for 3D visualizations and scientific calculations that was conceived and written by Dr. Christian Perwass. CLUCalc interprets a script language called ‘CLUScript’, which has been designed to make mathematical calculations and visualisations very intuitive.

This repository contains the original unmodified source from the archive CLUCalcSource-4.3.3.tar.gz for Linux released in 2005. The purpose of this repository is to make the untouched source code available for cloning and further development in other repositories.

This software implements Geometric Algebra and visualizes the geometry represented by multivectors. Rendering is via OpenGL and LaTeX. Newer versions are also freely available as binaries for only Windows. It appears that 4.3.3 was the last GPL source code release for Linux.
